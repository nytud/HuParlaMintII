# HuParlaMintII

Codes and metadata used to build the Hungarian corpus in the ParlaMint II project of Clarin ERIC.

The corpus itself will be made publicly available following the close of the project ParlaMint in March 2023 through concordancers. A sample of the data is already available on [GitHub](https://github.com/clarin-eric/ParlaMint).
